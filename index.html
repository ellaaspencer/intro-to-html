    <p>My name is Ella Asselstine, and I am a first-year student in Algonquin’s Graphic Design program. For the last five years, I have been publishing my own pop-culture magazine. I joined Graphic Design with hopes to improve my layout and typography skills. I am excited to see how my improvements translate onto the page. So far, I have been having fun with Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop – though I am also very excited to start coding. </p>
 
 
    <p> My hobbies outside of graphic design include photography, painting, baking, and reading. I like film photography, and occasionally rent out studios to take photos of my friends. I also know many creatives in Ottawa, hence the photo above. I also play the bass guitar. My favourite artists to cover are The Beatles and Blur.</p>
